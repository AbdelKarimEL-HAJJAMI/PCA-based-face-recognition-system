# PCA-based-face-recognition-system

Implementation of a program allowing face recognition using the PCA method w/ MATLAB

A simple approach can be to do a nearest neighbours from all the faces in the training data. But a facial image can have a huge number of features as a huge number of pixels and a lot of faces in the database. So we project the faces in a lower dimensional space using a classical dimension reduction algorithm : PCA.

The program uses a dataset which contains 240 images of 40 people with various facial expressions and under various lighting conditions.
The models are trained with
